# Azure Storage Account (secure-by-default)

[![IaC Bazaar: live-tested](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/azure-storage-account/badge)](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/azure-storage-account?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=artifact)

Storage account with containers/file shares, lifecycle rules, network rules, CMK encryption and private endpoint options - Azure's most-deployed resource done right.

This module was **applied to a real Azure account, verified, and destroyed** on 2026-06-29 - not just `terraform validate`d.

Check it yourself, no account needed:

```
curl -s https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/azure-storage-account/verification
```

The receipt names every check that ran, when it ran, and the SHA-256 of the
archive it describes. Full detail: [www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/azure-storage-account](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/azure-storage-account)

## Usage

```hcl
module "storage_account" {
  source  = "registry.terraform.io/CyberCoreSystems/storage-account/azurerm"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # See variables.tf for the full input contract.
}
```

## Why this module

Every module we publish goes through the same checks before release:

| check | what it means |
|---|---|
| `tofu validate` + `tflint` | it parses and lints clean |
| `checkov` | scanned for insecure defaults |
| **live test** | **really applied to a cloud account, outputs verified, then destroyed** |

That last row is the one most module catalogues skip. A module that has never
been applied has never been proven.

## Provider compatibility

```
azurerm >= 4.0, < 5.0
```
